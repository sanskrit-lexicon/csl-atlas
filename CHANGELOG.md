## [Unreleased]

### 2026-06-11 — OBS corpus-evidence layer and two manuscripts

#### Added
- **OBS-R / OBS-C findings** (corpus-wide, all 43 dicts): `docs/CORPUS_REDUNDANCY_GENEALOGY.md` (1.49M entries → 409,649 distinct lemmas = 3.65:1; 57.9% redundant; MW-absorber stemma) and `docs/CITATION_REGISTERS.md` (two citation registers — European `<ls>` 1.23M / 59% resolvable vs indigenous `iti` SKD 69k/VCP 22k/KRM 6.4k). `OBS-R`/`OBS-C` rows added to `docs/HYPOTHESIS_INDEX.md`. (PRs #53–#55.)
- **Generators**: `scripts/obs/headword_multiplicity.py` (format-aware — reads the abch/acph/acsj `<syns>` kośa markup, so all 43 dicts are counted) and `scripts/obs/siglum_families.py` (abbreviation-family review-candidate generator).
- **Reviewed source-abbreviation table**: `src/data/dict-source-aliases.json` grown from the seed to 27 canonical works (138 aliases); reasoning in `docs/SIGLUM_ALIAS_ADJUDICATION.md`. (PR #55.)
- **Two draft manuscripts** in `docs/articles/` (IJL-targeted): `paper_redundancy_and_descent.md` (OBS-R) and `paper_citation_registers.md` (OBS-C). (PRs #68, #69.)
- `.gitignore`: `src/*.pdf` (scoped; tracked `docs/refs/` PDFs unaffected). (PR #66.)

#### Notes
- OBS-R/OBS-C are corpus-wide quantifications of existing Type-1 hypotheses (`M1-M2-MACRO`, `XREF-CORE`, `INDIG-CITE`), not parallel claims; containment is treated as a floor for overlap, **not** proof of copying.
- Manuscripts are working drafts: secondary-literature citations are flagged `[TODO]` and the byline/venue are the author's to finalise.
- The org-process twin **OBS-Q** (correction sustainability) lives in `csl-observatory`, per the boundary rules.

### 2026-06-03 — Review-release roadmap and Reader Lookup v1

#### Added
- Review-release planning docs: `docs/REVIEW_RELEASE_ROADMAP.md`, `docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`, and `docs/LIGHT_REVIEW_SPRINT.md`.
- Reader Lookup v1: static dictionary-first headword lookup backed by `src/data/dicts/lemma-lookup.json` for lemmas attested in >=4 target dictionaries.
- Shared lookup normalization module for SLP1 and IAST query candidates, with unit tests.
- Public Reader Mode entry in the sidebar and landing page.
- Dictionary-structure pages moved in from `csl-observatory`: dictionary genealogy, convention fingerprints, and R2 sense-structure pages.

#### Notes
- Reader Lookup v1 is exact/prefix headword lookup only; lower-coverage lemmas remain omitted. It is not full-text dictionary search, corpus lookup, sandhi recovery, Devanagari input, or `LexemeHub`.
- The light review sprint prepares worklists for human review; it does not mark philological decisions as complete.
- TEI/OntoLex/FrAC standards work moved out of `csl-atlas` to `csl-standards`.
- DCS corpus inventory work moved out of `csl-atlas`; migration copies live in `VisualDCS/docs/csl-atlas-migration/`.

### 2026-05-29 → 2026-05-31 — Evidence atlas build-out

A large expansion from the interoperability pilot into a deterministic, source-linked, evidence-labelled research atlas over the CDSL dictionaries and the DCS corpus reference data. Every generated claim is reproducible from `../csl-orig` / `../DCS` and carries `observed` / `derived` / `inferred` labels; no runtime LLM inference.

#### Added — documentation foundation
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/USE_CASES.md`, `docs/READER_DEVELOPER_CRITIQUE.md`.
- Reader-facing: `docs/DICTIONARY_USER_GUIDE.md`, `docs/EVIDENCE_LABELS.md`.
- Plans: `docs/DICTIONARY_COMPARISON_PLAN.md` (Phase 2), `docs/REVIEW_REPORTS.md`; DCS planning from this period was later migrated to VisualDCS.

#### Added — Phase 1: MW Quantitative Depth
- Pipeline `scripts/lib/mw-{parser,classifiers,source-layers,depth-graph}.mjs` + `build-mw-quantitative-depth.mjs` → `src/data/mw/*.json`; `validate-mw-depth`.
- Article-type classifier reproduces the committed typology counts exactly (grammar types primary-only + exclusive by priority m>f>n>mfn>ind).
- Conservative source-layer seed map (`src/data/mw-source-layers.json`) with a base-form fallback; unmapped citations cut from 31.9% to ~9%.
- Pages: depth dashboard, diachronic layers, family depth.

#### Added — Phase 2: Comparative Dictionary Lab (MW, AP, PWG, PWK, WIL, VCP, SKD)
- `scripts/lib/dict-{normalize,manifest,parser,align}.mjs` + `build-dictionary-comparison.mjs`.
- Coverage matrix, pairwise overlap, all-dictionary intersection, dictionary-unique vocabulary, **homonym splits** (MW/PWG/PWK `<h>`), **gender disagreement** (all 7 — `<lex>` for tagged dicts, prose markers for VCP/SKD), **sense depth** (AP/PWG/PWK), **citation apparatus**, and an interactive **lemma dossier**.
- Cross-dictionary **source-siglum mapping**: diacritic/case fold + reviewed alias table (`src/data/dict-source-aliases.json`) → working source × dictionary matrix.

#### Added — Phase 3a: DCS corpus (later migrated)
- DCS schema inspection documented the local `../DCS/` export as reference data, not passage-level occurrences.
- The DCS inventory generator and page were later moved out of `csl-atlas`; migration copies live in `VisualDCS/docs/csl-atlas-migration/`.

#### Added — Review layer
- `data/schema/review-report.schema.json` + shared `scripts/lib/review-report.mjs` (overlay preserved across rebuilds by `reviewId`).
- Four queues with pages: gender conflicts (4,556), unknown source layers (449), low-confidence alignment (7), source-siglum aliases (151).

#### Added — site, tests, CI
- Sidebar + landing reorganized into purpose groups (MW depth · comparison · review · figures · paper · dictionaries).
- Unit tests via Node's built-in `node:test` (`npm test`, 39 tests) covering the lib modules and orchestrator decision helpers; build orchestrators made import-safe (guarded `main()`).
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` gates PRs.

### Baseline — Interoperability pilot (≤ 2026-05-29)
- MW-PWG-PWK hard-case interoperability track: 50-case TEI archival + OntoLex/FrAC pilot, loss reports, and validation harnesses. This track now lives in `csl-standards`.
- Nine narrative dictionary chapters and the microanalysis paper pages.
