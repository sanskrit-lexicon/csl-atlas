# Changelog

All notable changes to csl-atlas are documented here. Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). Dates are ISO. The atlas is unversioned (static site); entries are grouped by date.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-13

### 2026-06-10 — R2 page regeneration + deferred engineering

#### Added
- **R2 page regeneration** (`scripts/build-r2-pages.mjs`): data-driven SVG generators for three R2 tool pages from live JSON. Pure helpers exported for testing: `yearToX`, `rateToY`, `patternColor`, `h1Points`, `h2Bars`, `h3rDumbbells`. Marker-based file injection ensures idempotent updates.
  - **H1 scatter** (720×440): sense-granularity vs publication year from `r2_h1.json`, family legend, Pearson-r caption.
  - **H2 bars** (720×300): citation-survival rates from `r2_h2h3.json`, two groups (Cited/Uncited), 4 bars (restored+archived per group), gap annotation.
  - **H3R dumbbell** (720×300): sense-drift per inheritance edge, 3 rows, dumbbell marks with arrowheads, pattern colors, overlap labels, archived ghost circles.
  - **New page** `src/tools/r2-h2h3.md`: H2/H3R analysis with data table and findings paragraph; all numbers live from JSON.
  - Navigation: r2-h2h3 added to `observablehq.config.js`.
- **H1 panel viz refresh**: `r2-h1.md` now shows generated full-corpus scatter + new 30-lemma deconfounded panel scatter (via `h1PanelPoints` in `build-r2-pages.mjs`). Archived static SVG removed; Trust Block updated to live-data language.
- **Sense-divergence map**: `src/tools/sense-divergence.md` Observable Framework page with filterable ranked table of 1,282 lemmas with entry-count range > 0 (out of 6,777 total). Data from `data/lexico/sense_divergence.json`; generator `scripts/lexico/build_divergence_map.py`. Added to Review queues nav.

#### Tests
- 5 new tests for R2 page generators (patternColor, yearToX, rateToY, h1Points, h2Bars, h3rDumbbells). 2 new tests for H1 panel helpers. Total: 140 tests pass.

### 2026-06-03 — Review-release roadmap and Reader Lookup v1

#### Added
- Review-release planning docs: `docs/REVIEW_RELEASE_ROADMAP.md`, `docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`, and `docs/LIGHT_REVIEW_SPRINT.md`.
- Reader Lookup v1: static dictionary-first headword lookup backed by `src/data/dicts/lemma-lookup.json` for lemmas attested in >=4 target dictionaries.
- Shared lookup normalization module for SLP1 and IAST query candidates, with unit tests.
- Public Reader Mode entry in the sidebar and landing page.
- Dictionary-structure pages moved in from `csl-observatory`: dictionary genealogy, convention fingerprints, and R2 sense-structure pages.

#### Notes
- Reader Lookup v1 is exact/prefix headword lookup only; lower-coverage lemmas remain omitted. It is not full-text dictionary search, corpus lookup, sandhi recovery, Devanagari input, or `LexemeHub`.
- The light review sprint prepares worklists for human review; it does not mark philological decisions as complete.
- TEI/OntoLex/FrAC standards work moved out of `csl-atlas` to `csl-standards`.
- DCS corpus inventory work moved out of `csl-atlas`; migration copies live in `VisualDCS/docs/csl-atlas-migration/`.

### 2026-05-29 → 2026-05-31 — Evidence atlas build-out

A large expansion from the interoperability pilot into a deterministic, source-linked, evidence-labelled research atlas over the CDSL dictionaries and the DCS corpus reference data. Every generated claim is reproducible from `../csl-orig` / `../DCS` and carries `observed` / `derived` / `inferred` labels; no runtime LLM inference.

#### Added — documentation foundation
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/USE_CASES.md`, `docs/READER_DEVELOPER_CRITIQUE.md`.
- Reader-facing: `docs/DICTIONARY_USER_GUIDE.md`, `docs/EVIDENCE_LABELS.md`.
- Plans: `docs/DICTIONARY_COMPARISON_PLAN.md` (Phase 2), `docs/REVIEW_REPORTS.md`; DCS planning from this period was later migrated to VisualDCS.

#### Added — Phase 1: MW Quantitative Depth
- Pipeline `scripts/lib/mw-{parser,classifiers,source-layers,depth-graph}.mjs` + `build-mw-quantitative-depth.mjs` → `src/data/mw/*.json`; `validate-mw-depth`.
- Article-type classifier reproduces the committed typology counts exactly (grammar types primary-only + exclusive by priority m>f>n>mfn>ind).
- Conservative source-layer seed map (`src/data/mw-source-layers.json`) with a base-form fallback; unmapped citations cut from 31.9% to ~9%.
- Pages: depth dashboard, diachronic layers, family depth.

#### Added — Phase 2: Comparative Dictionary Lab (MW, AP, PWG, PWK, WIL, VCP, SKD)
- `scripts/lib/dict-{normalize,manifest,parser,align}.mjs` + `build-dictionary-comparison.mjs`.
- Coverage matrix, pairwise overlap, all-dictionary intersection, dictionary-unique vocabulary, **homonym splits** (MW/PWG/PWK `<h>`), **gender disagreement** (all 7 — `<lex>` for tagged dicts, prose markers for VCP/SKD), **sense depth** (AP/PWG/PWK), **citation apparatus**, and an interactive **lemma dossier**.
- Cross-dictionary **source-siglum mapping**: diacritic/case fold + reviewed alias table (`src/data/dict-source-aliases.json`) → working source × dictionary matrix.

#### Added — Phase 3a: DCS corpus (later migrated)
- DCS schema inspection documented the local `../DCS/` export as reference data, not passage-level occurrences.
- The DCS inventory generator and page were later moved out of `csl-atlas`; migration copies live in `VisualDCS/docs/csl-atlas-migration/`.

#### Added — Review layer
- `data/schema/review-report.schema.json` + shared `scripts/lib/review-report.mjs` (overlay preserved across rebuilds by `reviewId`).
- Four queues with pages: gender conflicts (4,556), unknown source layers (449), low-confidence alignment (7), source-siglum aliases (151).

#### Added — site, tests, CI
- Sidebar + landing reorganized into purpose groups (MW depth · comparison · review · figures · paper · dictionaries).
- Unit tests via Node's built-in `node:test` (`npm test`, 39 tests) covering the lib modules and orchestrator decision helpers; build orchestrators made import-safe (guarded `main()`).
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` gates PRs.

### Baseline — Interoperability pilot (≤ 2026-05-29)
- MW-PWG-PWK hard-case interoperability track: 50-case TEI archival + OntoLex/FrAC pilot, loss reports, and validation harnesses. This track now lives in `csl-standards`.
- Nine narrative dictionary chapters and the microanalysis paper pages.
